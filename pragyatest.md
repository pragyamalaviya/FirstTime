### Pragya Test 
# AI waves its magic wand at the old treasure:
## Imagine bringing life into moments that were once lost, getting a glimpse into the past and watching
those magical parts of the past come alive playing on the big screen, the ethereal bliss it would bring
is beyond compare.

### That’s exactly what AI is making possible today. Very old film reels that were denigrating with
exposure to light, temperature and time, are getting new life with AI aided technologies. And there’s
more, with digital restoration it’s not just about preserving *cultural heritage* or peeking into the past,
there is also a `huge business opportunity.` The global film and video industry of worth **$244.43 billion
(2021) is anticipated to grow at a rate of 11.8% by the end of 2022 to $273.35 billion** and with this
huge a potential, it’s like hitting gold.

All of this being said, ~~there would always be the purists who would be biased towards the grittiness,~~
texture of the old fashioned film reels, but restoring these flicks to enable travelling back in time is
another story people of the future would definitely be more interested in.
On the flip side, there
always be movies nobody really wants to rediscover but why not focus on the whole slew of talkies
that are worth preserving because they are pure classics. 
    ` And who knows, future generations will,
thanks to AI, enjoy these movies of the past as much as we do now. `
